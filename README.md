# Project Title

MyToken Smart Contract

## Description

This project is a simple token smart contract written in Solidity. It includes basic functionalities such as minting and burning tokens. The contract keeps track of the total supply of tokens and the balance of tokens for each address.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To use this smart contract, you'll need:

* A Solidity compiler e.g., via Remix IDE (Online can be used).

### Executing program

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Deploying the Contract:
* Copy the Solidity code into your Solidity environment (e.g., Remix IDE).
* Compile the contract.
* Deploy the contract to your desired Ethereum network.

2. Call the mint function with the address and amount of tokens you want to mint.

3. Call the burn function with the address and amount of tokens you want to burn.
   
4. Use the balances mapping to check the token balance of an address.
   
5. Use the totalSupply variable to check the total supply of tokens.

## Help

For common issues or problems:

* Ensure you have a compatible Solidity compiler version (0.8.18 or later).
* Make sure you have sufficient funds (ETH) to deploy and interact with the contract on a testnet or mainnet.
